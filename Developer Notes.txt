Next routing

1) to create an api route, common convention is create api folder in app folder,
then create another folder which is the name of the route, then a route.ts. 
Then you can access the route via url/api/routename

2) to organize multiple routes, you can put the routes in a (group) folder, which doesnt get added to url
- this group folder structure is powerful since you can add global styles to all routes inside the folder
by adding a layout.tsx
